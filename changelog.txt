04.01.2008 - Version 1.1
------------------------

I have created a control panel that allows access to all of the infusion's settings:

- From the admin area you will can now launch manual member checks,
  not only optimized (continuing from the last checked member),
  but also from the very first member to the last one.

- The slap counter can now be reset if you want.

- The frequency of the member checks can be easily adjusted, manually changing
  the $frequency variable (previously used) being now outdated.
